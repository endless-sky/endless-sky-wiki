Endless Sky is an open source project. Our end goal is for the universe to contain stories and content created by many different people, so that there are always new places to explore and each section of the galaxy (or other galaxies!) has its own unique flavor.

At the moment, the greatest need is for beta testers, but you can also contribute in one of the following ways:

### Non-programming tasks

  * Audio: create a set of higher-quality sound effects, or work on better volume balancing of the current ones. The sound effects should be subtle so that they don't get annoying.

  * Photography: contribute or find open-source photos for planet landscapes or conversation "scenes." Especially cool would be some "matte paintings" or 3D renderings of the inside of futuristic space stations.

  * [Missions](CreatingMissions): writing new side missions either to go with the main story lines, or completely independent of them.

  * Editing: fixing boring or badly written parts of the planet descriptions or mission text.

  * Creating new aliens: each species should have a different set of [ships](CreatingShips) and [weapons](CreatingOutfits), a [region of space](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky-editor) that they inhabit, and a story line to go with them.

### Programming tasks

  * Linux: Debian package maintainer.

### Testing

  * Try different operating systems, including various Linux distributions and different Mac and Windows versions.

  * Play-test the missions to find any confusing or broken parts.

  * Balancing of weapons and other equipment: decide whether some are currently over-powered or under-powered.

  * Economic balancing: are there stages of the game where making money feels too easy or too difficult? Are the various ways to make money equally good: trade routes vs. missions vs. fighting pirates?
