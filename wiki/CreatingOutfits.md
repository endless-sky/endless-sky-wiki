# Outfit graphics

The thumbnail graphics for all the outfits in the game are created using two free, open source programs: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for creating the 3D models, and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for post-processing the rendered images to look more grungy and less artificial. (Another open source program, [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), is used for the vector graphics in the user interface.) You can download the original Blender and GIMP files for any of the graphics [here](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/endless-sky-assets/).

Any outfit model you create in Blender should use the camera and lighting settings from [this template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/EndlessSky-Discord-Bot/master/data/templates/outfittemplate.blend). That will ensure that your new thumbnails do not look out of place next to the existing ones. The template is set up with sunlight coming from a certain angle and with the image rendered in an orthographic projection along the XYZ diagonal, so that a cube in your model will line up exactly with the cubical grid used as a backdrop for the outfits.

The outfitter view divides outfits into difference categories: "Guns," "Turrets," etc. As another way of ensuring a consistent look, most outfits in a given section point in a certain direction:

* Guns: top left.
* Turrets: top left, and angled slightly up in the Z axis.
* Missiles: bottom left.
* Anti-missiles: top right.
* Engines: bottom right.

In a few cases, it's ambiguous which direction something should point in. For example, the Flamethrower is aligned with the guns even though it is shown in the "Secondary Weapons" section with all the missiles.

As with [ships](CreatingShips), it is often easier to add texture and color variation to the outfit images in GIMP rather than trying to texture map all the surfaces in Blender. And, also as with the ship graphics, be sure that your GIMP file is at least high enough resolution to create an "@2x" high resolution version.

# Outfit attributes

Outfits work by modifying the attributes of your ship. Many of the attributes are in units of heat or energy per frame; a frame is 1/60th of a second. All attributes stack. For example, if you install two shield generators, your shield regeneration doubles.

Most attributes are given as a single number, but there are a few "special" attributes:

* `category`: which outfitter category to show this outfit in. The category must be one of the following if it is to be purchasable:
  * "Guns"
  * "Turrets"
  * "Secondary Weapons"
  * "Ammunition"
  * "Systems"
  * "Power"
  * "Engines"
  * "Hand to Hand"
  * "Special"

* `"display name"`: An alternative name to display in the UI for this outfit, can be used for renaming outfits if that ever becomes needed. This attribute should typically not be set, since we don't plan on renaming outfits often.

* `"flotsam sprite"`: the image that is drawn when this outfit is dropped in space, either because it was jettisoned by a ship or because it was the payload of a minable asteroid. If no flotsam sprite is given, then the default flotsam box is used.

* `"flotsam chance"`: a value from 0 to 1 that denotes the chance that any given unit of this outfit will survive its ship being destroyed as a flotsam that can be picked up by other ships. Ammunition has a default flotsam chance of 5%, should no flotsam chance be provided. All other outfits have a default of 0%. A negative flotsam chance can be used on ammunition to mean that the outfit will never drop as a flotsam. **(v. 0.10.0)**

* `"flare sprite"`: for thrusters, the image that is drawn at each of the engine [hardpoints](CreatingShips) when the thruster is firing.

  * Beginning with **v. 0.9.13**, `"reverse flare sprite"` and `"steering flare sprite"` can also be used to define the image that is drawn for `"reverse engine"` and `"steering engine"` hardpoints on a ship.

* `"flare sound"`: for thrusters, the sound that is played when the thruster is firing.

  * Beginning with **v. 0.9.13**, `"reverse flare sound"` and `"steering flare sound"` can also be used to define the sound that is played when reversing or steering. Sounds are only played if the ship has an associated `"reverse engine"` or `"steering engine"` hardpoint for a flare to be emitted from.

* `"afterburner effect"`: the [effect](CreatingEffects) that is created for every frame that the afterburner is firing. Afterburner effects can last for multiple frames, leaving a trail behind the ship.

* `thumbnail`: the thumbnail image to use for the outfit in the outfitter. Outfit thumbnails should be no larger than 360x360 for the @2x sprite and 180x180 for the normal-resolution sprite.

* `licenses`: a list of names of licenses you need to buy this outfit. For each `<name>` specified, the [`license: <name>` condition](Player-Conditions) must be set for the player to buy this ship. **(v. 0.9.7)** (If you make an outfit named `"<name> License"`, that condition variable will automatically be set when you buy that outfit.)

* Beginning with **v. 0.9.13**, the sound and effects of a drive can be customized. If multiple drives are installed that each have their own sounds and effects, then all sounds and effects are played at once.

  * `"jump effect"`: the [effect](CreatingEffects) that is created on a ship when using a jump drive.

  * `"jump sound"`: The sound that the flagship's jump drive makes when jumping. For other ships, use `"jump in sound"` and `"jump out sound"` for the sound that is played when other ships jump into or out of the player's current system.

  * `"hyperdrive sound"`: The same as `"jump sound"`, but for hyperdrives. Also has a `"hyperdrive in sound"` and `"hyperdrive out sound"` for other ships jumping into or out of the current system.

* `description`: a paragraph of text to show in the outfitter. To define multiple paragraphs, you can add more than one "description" line.

Unless otherwise stated, other outfit attributes will stack additively between multiple outfits and can only have values greater than 0. The other attributes include the following:

* These attributes are basic attributes that practically every outfit will have.

  * `cost`: cost of this outfit, in credits.

  * `mass`: how much your ship's mass should change by when this outfit is installed.

* These attributes are used to alter various capacities of the ship they are installed on, limiting the number of outfits that can be installed at once.

  * `"outfit space"`: if negative, how much generic outfit space (as opposed to weapon or engine space) this outfit takes up.

  * `"engine capacity"`: if negative, how much engine space an outfit uses. Engine space and weapon space are an important part of giving different ship models different strengths and weaknesses, so I recommend against creating outfits that give you extra engine capacity, or engines that do not use up engine space.

  * `"weapon capacity"`: set this to a negative value (generally, the same value as `"outfit space"`) for any outfit that is a weapon. Limited weapon space is one of the ways that ship models are differentiated from each other.

  * `"cargo space"`: amount of cargo space that this outfit adds (if positive) or removes (if negative) from your ship.

* These attributes alter the legality of an outfit.

  * `atrocity`: if you are caught carrying this outfit, the government that scanned you turns hostile. If the scan happens when you are landed on a planet, you are immediately captured and imprisoned for life.

  * `illegal`: the fine, in credits, for being caught using this outfit.

* These attributes are used to alter and repair the shields and hull of a ship.

  * `shields`: an additional number of shield points added to a ship's base shields value.

  * `"shield generation"`: the number of shield points regenerated per frame. It takes 1 energy to regenerate 1 unit of shields, so if your shields are recharging, your ship has less energy available for other things.

  * `"shield energy"`: the amount of energy your shield generator draws when recharging at the full rate. (**Prior to v. 0.9.0,** shield recharge also draws an additional amount of energy equal to `"shield generation"`.) Beginning in **v. 0.9.13**, this value is capable of being negative, causing shield generation to grant energy.

  * `"shield heat"`: the amount of heat that shield generation creates when recharging at the full rate. **(v. 0.9.1)** Beginning in **v. 0.9.13**, this value is capable of being negative, causing shield generation to reduce heat.

  * `"shield fuel"`: the amount of fuel that shield regeneration consumes when recharging at the full rate. **(v. 0.9.9)** Beginning in **v. 0.9.13**, this value is capable of being negative, causing shield generation to grant fuel.

  * `"shield delay"`: the number of frames that must pass without taking shield damage in order for shield generation to begin. **(v. 0.9.13)** Beginning in **v. 0.10.7**, this only impacts the delayed shield attributes described below.

  * `"depleted shield delay"`: the number of frames that must pass after the shields have been depleted (i.e. reached 0) in order for shield generation to begin. **(v. 0.9.13)** Beginning in **v. 0.10.7**, this only impacts the delayed shield attributes described below.

  * `"delayed shield generation"`: shield generation that is only active when the above shield delay timers have hit zero. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"delayed shield energy"`: shield energy that is only active when the above shield delay timers have hit zero. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"delayed shield heat"`: shield heat that is only active when the above shield delay timers have hit zero. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"delayed shield fuel"`: shield fuel that is only active when the above shield delay timers have hit zero. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"high shield permeability"`: The permeability of your shields while they are at 100% strength. A shield which is permeable allows some damage to bleed through to the hull. For example, a permeability of 10% means that 90% of the damage hits the shields and 10% hits the hull. As shield strength drops, the permeability of your shields approaches the low shield permeability value. **(v. 0.10.1)**

  * `"low shield permeability"`: The permeability of your shields as they approach 0%. A shield which is permeable allows some damage to bleed through to the hull. For example, a permeability of 10% means that 90% of the damage hits the shields and 10% hits the hull. As shield strength increases, the permeability of your shields approaches the high shield permeability value. **(v. 0.10.1)**

  * `hull`: an additional number of hull points added to a ship's base hull value.

  * `"hull repair rate"`: the number of hull points regenerated per frame. It takes 1 energy to repair 1 unit of hull.

  * `"hull energy"`: the amount of energy that hull repair draws when recharging at the full rate. (**Prior to v. 0.9.0,** hull repair also draws an additional amount of energy equal to `"hull repair rate"`.) Beginning in **v. 0.9.13**, this value is capable of being negative, causing hull repairs to grant energy.

  * `"hull heat"`: the amount of heat that hull repair creates when recharging at the full rate. **(v. 0.9.1)** Beginning in **v. 0.9.13**, this value is capable of being negative, causing hull repairs to reduce heat.

  * `"hull fuel"`: the amount of fuel that hull repair consumes when recharging at the full rate. **(v. 0.9.9)** Beginning in **v. 0.9.13**, this value is capable of being negative, causing hull repairs to grant fuel.

  * `"repair delay"`: the number of frames that must pass without taking hull damage in order for hull repairs to begin. **(v. 0.9.13)** Beginning in **v. 0.10.7**, this only impacts the delayed hull repair attributes described below.

  * `"disabled repair delay"`: the number of frames that must pass without taking hull damage after the ship has been disabled in order for hull repairs to begin. Note that the delay timers for both hull and shields do not decrease while the ship is unable to repair itself (i.e. it is disabled), so this attribute is the time after the ship has been assisted for repairs to start. **(v. 0.9.13)** Beginning in **v. 0.10.7**, this only impacts the delayed hull repair attributes described below.

  * `"delayed hull repair rate"`: hull repair rate that is only active when the above repair delay timers have hit zero. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"delayed hull energy"`: hull energy that is only active when the above repair delay timers have hit zero. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"delayed hull heat"`: hull heat that is only active when the above repair delay timers have hit zero. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"delayed hull fuel"`: hull fuel that is only active when the above repair delay timers have hit zero. **(v. 0.10.7)**

* These attributes change the point at which a ship becomes disabled. The default point at which a ship becomes disabled is dictated by the equation `hull * max(.15, min(.45, 10. / sqrt(hull)))`. **(v. 0.9.13)**

  * `"absolute threshold"`: the exact hull value at which a ship becomes disabled. Having this attribute overrides the effects of any other attributes that change when a ship becomes disabled. Suggested that this not be changed by outfits, instead being an attribute applied directly to a ship.

  * `"threshold percentage"`: a value between 0 and 1 that represents the percentage of the hull remaining for the ship to become disabled, causing the equation for when a ship becomes disabled to be `hull * "threshold percentage"`.

  * `"hull threshold"`: a hull value that gets added or subtracted from the result of either the default equation or the threshold percentage equation, whichever is used.

* Some ships have the ability to repair themselves (after a certain amount of time) once the ship is disabled. The `"disabled recovery time"` attribute gives the number of seconds it takes for a disabled ship to repair itself. Self-repair could have some costs, for example:

  * `"disabled recovery energy"` The energy cost required for a disabled ship to repair itself.

  * `"disabled recovery fuel"` The fuel cost required for a disabled ship to repair itself.

  * `"disabled recovery heat"` The heat applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

  * `"disabled recovery ionization"` The ion damage applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

  * `"disabled recovery scrambling"` The scrambling damage applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

  * `"disabled recovery disruption"` The disruption damage applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

  * `"disabled recovery slowing"` The slowing damage applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

  * `"disabled recovery discharge"` The discharge damage applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

  * `"disabled recovery corrosion"` The corrosion damage applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

  * `"disabled recovery leak"` The leak damage applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

  * `"disabled recovery burning"` The burning damage applied when a disabled ship repairs itself.

* Most of the above shield and hull attributes also have "multiplier" attributes that will alter what value they have on a ship according to the equation `stat * (1 + multiplier)`, which means that the default value of 0 means no change, while a value of 1 would be a +100% increase in the stat. These attributes are capable of having negative values down to -1 (meaning -100%), where negative values result in reducing the value of the associated stat. **(v. 0.9.13)**
  
  * `"shield generation multiplier"`: multiplies the shield generation value of other outfits. 
  
  * `"shield energy multiplier"`: multiplies the shield energy value of other outfits. 
  
  * `"shield heat multiplier"`: multiplies the shield heat value of other outfits. 
  
  * `"shield fuel multiplier"`: multiplies the shield fuel value of other outfits.

  * `"shield multiplier"`: multiplies the maximum shield value of the ship. **(v. 0.10.3)**
  
  * `"hull repair multiplier"`: multiplies the hull repair rate value of other outfits. 
  
  * `"hull energy multiplier"`: multiplies the hull energy value of other outfits. 
  
  * `"hull heat multiplier"`: multiplies the hull heat value of other outfits. 
  
  * `"hull fuel multiplier"`: multiplies the hull fuel value of other outfits.

  * `"hull multiplier"`: multiplies the maximum hull value of the ship. **(v. 0.10.3)**

* These attributes are generally related to power generators and batteries.

  * `"energy capacity"`: how much energy your ship can store.

  * `"energy generation"`: energy generated each frame. If you do not have any energy capacity, this energy does not carry over from frame to frame.

  * `"energy consumption"`: energy consumed each frame. **(v. 0.9.7)**

  * `"heat generation"`: how much heat this outfit generates every turn, regardless of whether it is working at full capacity or not. For example, a power generator will create its full amount of heat even if your batteries are fully charged and the energy it creates is just being thrown away.

* These attributes will change in effectiveness given how close a ship is to the system center and what type of stars are in the system.

  * `ramscoop`: fuel regeneration. Each frame, your ship gains fuel proportional to .03 * &radic;("ramscoop"). The square root is so that each additional ramscoop will have less effect than the previous one; otherwise, ramscoops would make weapons and afterburners that run on fuel way too powerful. **As of v. 0.9.0,** ramscoops are more effective near the system center: the fuel gain is multiplied by `.2 + 1.8 / (distance to center / 1000 + 1)`. From **v. 0.9.0 to v. 0.9.16.1** when very close to the star, even ships with no ramscoop recharge a tiny amount of fuel. Beginning in **v. 0.9.9**, the amount of fuel gained varies based on the [solar wind](MapData#solar-attributes) of star(s) in the system.

  * `"solar collection"`: the amount of energy that this outfit provides when your ship is 1250 pixels from the system center. As you come closer, you will harvest up to twice as much power; farther away, and the energy generation slowly tapers off to 1/5 of this value. **(v. 0.9.0)** Beginning in **v. 0.9.9**, the amount of solar energy collected varies based on the [solar power](MapData#solar-attributes) of the star(s) in the current system.

  * `"solar heat"`: the amount of heat that this outfit produces when your ship is 1250 pixels from the system center. As with solar collection, heat increases up to two times this value the closer you are to the system center and decreases down to 1/5 of this value the farther away you are. This value will also vary based on the [solar power](MapData#solar-attributes) of the star(s) in the current system. **(v. 0.9.12)**

* These attributes alter the fuel capacity and usage of a ship.

  * `"fuel capacity"`: the amount of fuel storage provided by this outfit.

  * `"fuel consumption"`: the amount of fuel consumed per frame. **(v. 0.9.9)** On any frame in which the ship can supply its total `"fuel consumption"`, it will also evaluate the following attributes:

	* `"fuel energy"`: energy produced per frame from consumed fuel. **(v. 0.9.9)**

	* `"fuel heat"`: heat produced per frame from consumed fuel. **(v. 0.9.9)**

  * `"fuel generation"`: fuel produced per frame. **(v. 0.9.9)**

* These attributes are used to turn an outfit into an engine for ship movement.

  * `thrust`: your ship's acceleration per frame equals thrust / mass, and your ship's max speed is thrust / drag.

  * `"thrusting energy"`: energy cost per frame of thrusting.

  * `"thrusting leakage"`: leakage accumulated each frame when thrusting. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"thrusting burn"`: burn accumulated each frame when thrusting. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"thrusting slowing"`: slowing accumulated each frame when thrusting. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"thrusting disruption"`: disruption accumulated each frame when thrusting. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `turn`: your ship's turn rate is (turn / mass) degrees per frame.

  * `"turning energy"`:  energy cost per frame of turning.

  * `"turning heat"`: heat generated each frame when turning.

  * `"turning shields"`: shields consumed each frame when turning. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"reverse thrusting disruption"`: disruption accumulated each frame when reverse thrusting. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"afterburner thrust"`: thrust produced each frame when using an afterburner.
  
  * `"afterburner energy"`: energy consumed each frame when using an afterburner.

  * `"afterburner heat"`: heat produced each frame when using an afterburner.
  
  * `"afterburner fuel"`: fuel consumed each frame when using an afterburner.

  * `"afterburner shields"`: shields consumed each frame when using an afterburner. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"afterburner hull"`: hull consumed each frame when using an afterburner. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"afterburner discharge"`: discharge accumulated each frame when using an afterburner. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"afterburner slowing"`: slowing accumulated each frame when using an afterburner. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"afterburner disruption"`: disruption accumulated each frame when using an afterburner. **(v. 0.9.15)**

* Movement statistics can also be modified by these attributes, with the same behavior as described for shield and hull multipliers:

  * `"acceleration multiplier"`: multiplies the acceleration of the ship. **(v. 0.10.5)**

  * `"turn multiplier"`: multiplies the turn rate of the ship. **(v. 0.10.5)**

* These attributes relate to the cooling of a ship.

  * `cooling`: heat subtracted from your ship by this outfit, per frame.

  * `"active cooling"`: amount of cooling this outfit provides when heat is at 100%, at which level it will consume its entire `"cooling energy"`. When heat is at 0%, no energy is consumed and no active cooling is provided.

  * `"cooling energy"`: energy consumed by `"active cooling"` when heat is at 100%. Beginning with **v. 0.9.13** cooling energy can be net negative to allow for outfits that produce energy as heat increases.

  * `"heat dissipation"`: outfits should generally not modify this. If you want an outfit to help cool off a ship, use the "cooling" attribute instead.

  * `"heat capacity"`: adds to the ship's total mass where the ship's maximum heat capacity is concerned, but does not influence movement as mass does. A value of one is like adding one ton of mass to the ship for holding heat. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"overheat damage rate"`: the amount of hull damage dealt to this ship every frame in which it is overheated beyond its overheat threshold (100% on most ships, greater for ships with the attribute below). The damage increases in scale the further beyond the overheat threshold that the ship is (e.g. 2x beyond the threshold = 2x overheat damage). **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"overheat damage threshold"`: adds to the threshold at which point overheat damage kicks in. For example, a value of 0.2 would mean that the ship doesn't start taking overheat damage until it has reached 120% heat. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"cooling inefficiency"`: the higher this attribute is, the less effective your cooling systems are. Both active cooling and regular cooling will be multiplied by `2 + 2 / (1 + exp(i / -2)) - 4 / (1 + exp(i / -4))`, which forms the S-curve shown below. **(v. 0.9.7)**

[![cooling inefficiency][cooleff]][cooleff]

* These attributes relate to granting various types of scanning abilities, as well as combating them.

  * `"atmosphere scan"`: not usable by the player, but indicates that the AI will treat this ship as if it wants to fly past planets to "scan" them.

  * ~~`"cargo scan"`: sets the distance from which this outfit can be used to scan a ship's cargo.~~ **(Deprecated for scan power and speed in 0.9.5)**

  * `"cargo scan power"`: the cargo scanning range is 100 times the square root of this number. This means you need four scanners to get twice the range of one scanner. **(v. 0.9.5)**

  * ~~`"cargo scan speed"`: the time it takes to complete a cargo scan is one second divided by the square root of this number. This means you need four scanners to get twice the speed of one scanner. **(v. 0.9.5)**~~ **(Deprecated for scan efficiency in 0.10.0)**

  * `"cargo scan efficiency"`: the maximum cargo scanning speed is the square root of this number. The base scan time in frames is 600 divided by the square root of this value, but the actual scan time is impacted by various factors. In addition to your cargo scan speed, the scan time is also influenced by the distance to the target, with farther targets taking longer to scan, and the size of the target, with cargo holds above 200 tons taking longer to scan and cargo holds below 200 tons being quicker. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"cargo scan sound"`: the sound that is played when a player ship's cargo is being scanned, or when the player is scanning another ship's cargo. If not specified, the default sound is used instead. **(v. 0.10.9)**

  * `"cargo scan opacity"`: increases the time required for other ships to perform a cargo scan on the ship with this attribute. A value of one has the same influence on the time taken as adding one more ton of cargo space to scan. **(v. 0.10.3)**

  * ~~`"outfit scan"`: sets the distance from which this outfit can be used to scan a ship's outfits.~~ **(Deprecated for scan power and speed in 0.9.5)**

  * `"outfit scan power"`: the outfit scanning range is 100 times the square root of this number. This means you need four scanners to get twice the range of one scanner. **(v. 0.9.5)**

  * ~~`"outfit scan speed"`: the time it takes to complete an outfit scan is one second divided by the square root of this number. This means you need four scanners to get twice the speed of one scanner. **(v. 0.9.5)**~~ **(Deprecated for scan efficiency in 0.10.0)**

  * `"outfit scan efficiency"`: the maximum outfit scanning speed is the square root of this number. The base scan time in frames is 600 divided by the square root of this value, but the actual scan time is impacted by various factors. In addition to your outfit scan speed, the scan time is also influenced by the distance to the target, with farther targets taking longer to scan, and the size of the target, with outfit capacities above 200 tons taking longer to scan and outfit capacities below 200 tons being quicker. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"outfit scan sound"`: the sound that is played when a player ship's outfits are being scanned, or when the player is scanning another ship's outfits. If not specified, the default sound is used instead. **(v. 0.10.9)**

  * `"outfit scan opacity"`: increases the time required for other ships to perform an outfit scan on the ship with this attribute. A value of one has the same influence on the time taken as adding one more ton of outfit space to scan. **(v. 0.10.3)**

  * `"scan interference"`: your odds of a scan of your ship discovering anything illegal you have are equal to `1 / (1 + scan interference)`. For example, if "scan interference" is 3 you evade 75% of scans.

  * `"scan brightness"`: increases the chance that an illegal outfit will appear on a cargo scan. The cargo scan formula is as follows: `max(1., 2 * (illegal good mass + illegal good scan brightness) / legal good mass) / (1 + scan interference)`. In English, if you have 1 ton of illegal goods and 2 tons of legal goods then you have a 50% chance of your illegal goods being found on a cargo scan. The higher the ratio of legal to illegal goods, the lower your chances of being caught. If you have no legal goods or too many illegal goods then the chance caps out at `1 / (1 + scan interference)`. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"scan concealment"`: prevents an equivalent mass of illegal goods from being scanned. For example, if you had 6 tons of illegal goods and a scan concealment of 5, then only 1 ton of goods would be able to be scanned. The "mass" of illegal goods includes the scan brightness of those goods. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `inscrutable`: if a ship has a nonzero value for this attribute, you cannot scan its outfits. **(v. 0.9.7)**

  * `"asteroid scan power"`: the asteroid scanning range is 100 times the square root of this number. This allows you to identify and target minable asteroids. **(v. 0.9.9)**

  * `"tactical scan power"`: the tactical scanning range is 100 times the square root of this number. This gives you information on the distance to your target, as well as the fuel, energy, heat, and crew levels of the targeted ship if it is within the tactical scanning range. **(v. 0.9.9)**

* These attributes apply when partaking in boarding combat.

  * `"capture attack"`: this outfit can be wielded by a crew member and adds this amount to their base strength of 1 when attacking another ship's crew. Each crew member can only wield one such outfit, and they will make use of the best outfits available in each combat round.

  * `"capture defense"`: this outfit can be wielded by a crew member and adds this amount to their base strength of 2 when defending against boarders.

  * `unplunderable`: if set to 1, this outfit cannot be plundered (for example, for hand-to-hand weapons and outfit expansions). **(v. 0.9.0)**

* The following attributes are used to allow an outfit to grant the ability to jump between systems, and alter the behavior of jumping.

  * `hyperdrive`: set this to 1 if an outfit is a hyperdrive.

  * `"scram drive"`: a scram drive can engage as long as your ship is moving in the direction of the target system. This value is how much your ship can be drifting relative to that vector and still be allowed to jump.

  * `"jump drive"`: set this to 1 if this outfit is a jump drive.

  * `"jump speed"`: how slow your ship must be moving in order to jump.

  * `"jump fuel"`: how much fuel the ship consumes when using this outfit to jump. The default is 100 for hyperdrives, 150 for scram drives, and 200 for jump drives. Unlike other attributes, the jump fuel of multiple outfits will not stack. Instead, the lowest jump fuel among all installed outfits will be used. **(v. 0.9.7)**

  * `"jump mass cost"`: an additional jump fuel cost per 100 tons of ship mass. Adds to the base jump fuel cost above. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"jump base mass"`: a value that subtracts from a ship's mass during the jump mass cost calculation. If a drive's jump base mass is high enough and the ship's mass is low enough, the impact of the jump mass cost is allowed to go negative and begin subtracting from the normal jump fuel cost. Reducing your jump cost in this manner is only allowed to go as low as a cost of 1 fuel per jump. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"jump range"`: how far a ship can jump when using this outfit. The default jump range is 100. As with jump fuel, jump range does not stack between outfits. The outfit with the highest jump range will dictate the farthest a ship can jump. If a ship has multiple outfits with varying jump ranges, the one with the lowest jump fuel that is capable of making the given jump will be used. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* These attributes can be used to alter the crew stats of a ship.

  * `bunks`: additional crew / passenger space.

  * `"required crew"`: turrets (and maybe other high-end outfits) can increase your crew requirements. It might also make sense to provide outfits, such as an android crew replacement, that reduce crew requirements (in exchange for energy consumption or some other penalty).

  * `"crew equivalent"`: adds to the crew value of the ship when government reputation changes are applied for interacting with their ships. For example, a ship with a crew of 10 and a crew equivalent of 5 would be treated as if it had a crew of 15 for reputation hits, or a drone with a crew of 0 that normally doesn't incur a reputation hit for being destroyed can be given a crew equivalent of 1 so that a government cares about the destruction of its drones. This attribute is able to be negative, reducing the impact of interacting with a ship. Intended to be applied directly to ship hulls, rather than being on an outfit that the player could see. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"use crew equivalent as crew"`: modifies the behavior of the above `"crew equivalent"` attribute, causing the value of the attribute to be taken as the exact crew value instead of adding to it. For example, a ship with a crew of 10 and a crew equivalent of 5 would be treated as if it had a crew of 5 if this attribute were also present. This allows the reputation change that occurs when interacting with a ship to be known exactly, as ships typically have some random number of crew between their required crew and their total number of bunks. If this attribute is present but the other attribute is not, then the ship will be treated as if it had 0 crew for reputation changes. Intended to be applied directly to ship hulls, rather than being on an outfit that the player could see. **(v. 0.10.5)**

* These attributes define an outfit as occupying either a gun port or a turret mount on a ship, typically used for weapons.

  * `"gun ports"`: any weapon that fires forward (i.e. is not a turret) must have a value of -1 for this attribute. That is how the game recognizes that it is a gun. Outfits cannot provide more gun ports, because each gun must be tied to a specific hardpoint in the ship model. The only way to get more hardpoints is to upgrade to a bigger ship.

  * `"turret mounts"`: as with `"gun ports"`, any outfit that fits in a turret hardpoint must have a value of -1 for this.

* These attributes grant cloaking and alter its aspects.

  * `cloak`: how quickly a cloaking device cloaks or uncloaks. When cloaking, this amount is added to your cloaking each frame until you reach 1, at which point your ship is fully cloaked. The opposite happens when uncloaking.

  * `cloak by mass": similar to `cloak` except this value is divided by 1/1000 of the ships mass. For a ship with 1000 mass, this value works exactly like the same amount of `cloak`. For a ship with 500 mass, it would be like having twice as much of this value as `cloak`. The result of the division of this value is added to the `cloak` attribute value, so both can be applied to a single ship. For example, a ship with 2000 mass, 0.01 `cloak` and 0.1 `cloak by mass` would have an overall cloak rate of 0.06 units per frame. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloak hull threshold"`: the minimum fraction of hull a ship must have remaining in order to be able to cloak. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaking energy"`: how much energy it takes each frame to maintain cloaking.

  * `"cloaking fuel"`: how much fuel it takes each frame to maintain cloaking.

  * `"cloaking heat"`: how much heat is generated per frame to maintain cloaking.

  * `"cloak shield protection"`: how much more `"shield protection"` a ship has while cloaked. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloak hull protection"`: how much more `"hull protection"` a ship has while cloaked. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaking shield delay"`: increases the number of frames until delayed shield generation can activate by this much for every frame a ship is cloaked. If this value is less than 1, this is the chance that the delay will be increased by 1 every frame. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaking repair delay"`: increases the number of frames until delayed hull repair can activate by this much for every frame a ship is cloaked. If this value is less than 1, this is the chance that the delay will be increased by 1 every frame. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloak phasing"`: the chance that a projectile will phase through this ship while cloaked. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaked communication"`: when not 0, allows the player to hail other ships or planets while cloaked. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaked afterburner"`: when not 0, allows a ship to fire afterburners while cloaked. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaked boarding"`: when not 0, allows a ship to board other ships while cloaked. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaked deployment"`: when not 0, allows a ship to deploy or recall carried ships. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaked firing"`: when not 0, allows a ship to fire weapons while cloaked. If this value is negative, the remains fully cloaked while firing. A positive value represents how much cloaking is reduced by for each time a weapon is fired. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaked pickup"`: when not 0, allows a ship to pick up flotsam while cloaked. **(v. 0.10.7)**

  * `"cloaked scanning"`: when not 0, allows a ship to scan other ships while cloaked. **(v. 0.10.7)**

* These attributes grant resistance against special status effects.

  * `"disruption resistance"`: an extra amount of shield disruption that this ship "bleeds off" every frame. **(v. 0.9.9)**

  * `"disruption resistance (energy | heat | fuel)"`: the amount of energy, heat, or fuel that disruption resistance draws, creates, or consumes when active. **(v. 0.9.13)**

  * `"ion resistance"`: an extra amount of ionization that this ship "bleeds off" every frame. **(v. 0.9.9)**

  * `"ion resistance (energy | heat | fuel)"`: the amount of energy, heat, or fuel that ion resistance draws, creates, or consumes when active. **(v. 0.9.13)**

  * `"scramble resistance"`: an extra amount of scrambling that this ship "bleeds off" every frame. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"scramble resistance (energy | heat | fuel)"`: the amount of energy, heat, or fuel that scramble resistance draws, creates, or consumes when active. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"slowing resistance"`: an extra amount of slowing damage that this ship "bleeds off" every frame. **(v. 0.9.9)**

  * `"slowing resistance (energy | heat | fuel)"`: the amount of energy, heat, or fuel that slowing resistance draws, creates, or consumes when active. **(v. 0.9.13)**

  * `"discharge resistance"`: an extra amount of discharge damage that this ship "bleeds off" every frame. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"discharge resistance (energy | heat | fuel)"`: the amount of energy, heat, or fuel that discharge resistance draws, creates, or consumes when active. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"corrosion resistance"`: an extra amount of corrosion damage that this ship "bleeds off" every frame. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"corrosion resistance (energy | heat | fuel)"`: the amount of energy, heat, or fuel that corrosion resistance draws, creates, or consumes when active. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"leak resistance"`: an extra amount of leak damage that this ship "bleeds off" every frame. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"leak resistance (energy | heat | fuel)"`: the amount of energy, heat, or fuel that leak resistance draws, creates, or consumes when active. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"burn resistance"`: an extra amount of burn damage that this ship "bleeds off" every frame. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"burn resistance (energy | heat | fuel)"`: the amount of energy, heat, or fuel that burn resistance draws, creates, or consumes when active. **(v. 0.9.15)**
  
  * `"piercing resistance"`: this value subtracts from the piercing value of any incoming projectiles. For example, if an incoming projectile has a piercing value of 50% (.5) and you have a piercing resistance of 20% (.2), then the projectile will only pierce by 50% - 20% = 30%. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* These attributes reduce the impact of incoming damage according to the equation `1 / (1 + protection)`. That is, a total value of 1 will cut incoming damage in half, while a total value of 2 will cut incoming damage to a third of its original value. These values are capable of going down to -0.99. **(v. 0.9.13)**

  * `"disruption protection"`: protects against incoming disruption damage.
  
  * `"energy protection"`: protects against incoming energy damage.

  * `"force protection"`: protects against incoming hit force.
  
  * `"fuel protection"`: protects against incoming fuel damage.
  
  * `"heat protection"`: protects against incoming heat damage.
  
  * `"hull protection"`: protects against incoming hull damage.
  
  * `"ion protection"`: protects against incoming ion damage.
  
  * `"scramble protection"`: protects against incoming scrambling damage. **(v. 0.10.0)**
  
  * `"piercing protection"`: protects against incoming piercing projectiles by reducing the amount of piercing by the above equation.
  
  * `"shield protection"`: protects against incoming shield damage.
  
  * `"slowing protection"`: protects against incoming slowing damage.

  * `"discharge protection"`: protects against incoming discharge damage. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"corrosion protection"`: protects against incoming corrosion damage. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"leak protection"`: protects against incoming leak damage. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"burn protection"`: protects against incoming burn damage. **(v. 0.9.15)**

* These attributes can be used to cause outfits to incur a daily cost on or income for the player.

  * `"maintenance costs"`: how many credits per day are spent to "maintain" this outfit. Maintenance is paid for any owned ships or outfits. Overdue maintenance costs will not impact the efficiency of an outfit or ship. **(v. 0.9.11)**

  * `"operating costs"`: how many credits per day are spent to "maintain" this outfit. Differs from `"maintenance costs"` in that operating costs are only applied to actively in use outfits and ships, meaning parked ships or outfits in cargo won't charge the player. **(v. 0.9.11)**

  * `"income"`: how many credits per day are gained from this outfit. Income is gained for any owned ships or outfits. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"operating income"`: how many credits per day are gained from this outfit. Differs from `"income"` in that operating income is only gained from actively in use outfits and ships, meaning parked ships or outfits in cargo won't provide income for the player. **(v. 0.9.15)**

* These are miscellaneous attributes capable of being added to outfits.

  * `"ammo"`: if an outfit is not a weapon but is able to carry ammunition, that outfit should specify the ammo that it holds. This makes it so that if you sell the outfit carrying the ammunition, it will automatically sell any ammunition that would go over capacity instead of preventing the sale of the outfit. **(v. 0.9.5)**

  * `drag`: please do not create outfits that reduce a ship's drag, because if the drag becomes zero or negative it can cause problems (use `drag reduction` instead).

  * `"drag reduction"`: Reduces a ship's drag. The resulting drag is given by: `drag / (1 + reduction)`. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"inertia reduction"`: Reduces a ship's mass for the purposes of acceleration, turn, and hit force. The resulting inertial mass is given by: `mass / (1 + reduction)`. This does not impact mass' other effects, such as its effect on heat capacity or optical tracking. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `installable`: if set to a value below zero, this outfit cannot be installed. **From v. 0.9.0 to v. 0.9.15,** the trading panel displayed these outfits as "harvested materials." Starting in **v. 0.9.15** this behavior is handled by the `minable` attribute.

  * `minable`: if positive, the text "This item is mined from asteroids," will appear on the outfit in the outfitter. The trading panel will also display these outfits as "harvested materials." **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `map`: number of hyperlinked star systems that are mapped by this outfit.

  * `"radar jamming"`: how much resistance this ship has to radar tracking. The missile's chance of maintaining its lock is proportional to its `"radar tracking"` value divided by (1 + the ship's `"radar jamming"`). **(v. 0.9.1)**

  * `"optical jamming"`: how much resistance this ship has to optical tracking. The missile's chance of maintaining its lock is proportional to its `"optical tracking"` value divided by (1 + the ship's `"optical jamming"`). **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"self destruct"`: a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability that a ship will self-destruct when you try to plunder it or, after succeeding in boarding it without it self-destructing, try to capture it. That is, the probability of successfully boarding a ship with self-destruct is `(1 - "self destruct")`, and the probability of both boarding and capturing it is `(1 - "self destruct")^2`. **(v. 0.9.0)**

  * `"landing speed"`: a value between 0 and 1, representing progress made per frame when landing or taking off. This value is added every frame when landing or taking off from a planet or wormhole until reaching 1, at which point you'll be landed on the planet if landing or be able to control your ship if taking off. If a ship lacks this attribute, then a default value of 0.02 (50 frames to land/take off) is used. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `unique`: if present, the outfit is considered to be unique. When disowning a ship with a unique outfit or when launching from a planet that has unique outfits in stock that will be lost when you depart, a warning will be provided telling you that you will lose the unique outfits. Intended for use on outfits that are limited in quantity within a single save file; stuff that once lost, the player will never be able to reobtain.


# Weapon attributes

An outfit that provides a weapon contains an extra set of attributes inside a `weapon` tag. These attributes must be placed in the `weapon` block to have any effect. If you have multiple `weapon` blocks in one outfit, they are just merged together; that doesn't make an outfit provide two different weapons. Some weapon attributes have special formats:

* `sprite`: the path to the sprite, relative to the "images" folder, and not including the frame number or extension (e.g. "projectile/flamethrower", not "images/projectile/flamethrower+0.png"). The sprite field can also have "child" elements, which include:

  * `"frame rate" <fps#>`: animation frames per second.

  * `"frame time"`: game ticks per animation frame. A game tick is 1/60th of a second. This is an alternative way of specifying frame rate; if you specify both the last specification will be used.

  * `delay`: number of animation frames to delay in between loops of the animation. For example, a four-frame animation with a delay of 4 and a frame rate of 8 FPS will play the animation for half a second, then pause for half a second, then repeat.

  * `"start frame" <frame#>`: which frame to start the animation at.

  * `"random start frame"`: start the animation at a random frame (e.g. so if you fire a bunch of projectiles, they won't all be pulsing through the animation in unison with each other).

  * `"no repeat"`: the animation stops after it has played through once. (If "rewind" is also specified, it will play forward, then play backward, then stop.)

  * `rewind`: the animation plays forward, then reverses, rather than looping back to the beginning when it reaches the end.

* `"hardpoint sprite"`: the sprite (which ought to be very tiny) to draw on top of the hardpoint where this weapon is installed, to show what direction the weapon is pointing in. Generally, this should only be used for turrets, because the gun hardpoints on many ships are already designed to look like guns. This sprite definition can use any of the same animation values as the ship sprite. **(v. 0.9.7)**

* `"hardpoint offset"`: The distance, in screen pixels, between the center of the hardpoint sprite and the point that projectiles should emerge from. Assuming the gun barrel is at the very top of the sprite, this will be 25% of the sprite's height in pixels. The weapon's range is effectively increased by this amount. **(v. 0.9.7)**

  * For versions **v. 0.9.9** and later, can be an *x, y* coordinate relative to the center of the hardpoint sprite, e.g. `"hardpoint offset" -1.2 8.7`, in order to accommodate asymmetric hardpoint sprites. Axes orientation is the standard Cartesian, where `+x` is "rightward" and `+y` is "upward."

* `sound`: a path to a sound, relative to the "sounds" folder, and not including the extension or the loop specifier (e.g. "laser", not "sounds/laser~.wav"). The sound file must be a mono (not stereo) WAV file with 16-bit, 44100 Hz encoding.

* `ammo`: if specified, an outfit which provides ammunition for this weapon. Each time it is fired, one outfit of that type is removed from your ship.

  * For versions **v. 0.9.11** and later, a number following the ammo name will change how many units of that ammo are consumed upon firing the weapon. An ammo usage of 0 is possible, which results in the ammo outfit needing to be installed to fire, but never being consumed.

* `icon`: for secondary weapons, the icon that will be shown along with this weapon's ammunition count.

* [Effect objects][eft] are created for various stages of a projectile's existence:

  * `"fire effect"`: created when this weapon fires (such as a smoke cloud from a missile launch). You can specify a number to create more than one instance of the effect.

  * `"live effect"`: created while the projectile is in flight. You can specify the number of times this effect will be created, on average, during the projectile's lifetime. **(v. 0.9.0)**

  * `"hit effect"`: created when this projectile hits something. You can specify a number to create more than one instance of the effect. You can also specify multiple different hit effects.

  * `"target effect"`: created on any impacted ships. As with `"hit effect"`, a number can be specified to create more effects and multiple target effects can be used. If a ship was impacted through an explosion, the number of effects created is scaled with the damage. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"die effect"`: created if this projectile reaches the end of its lifetime without hitting anything.

* `"submunition" "<weapon>" <count#>`: if the projectile reaches its end of life, create a new set of projectiles based on the given weapon outfit. The damage and hit force associated with a parent projectile is the sum of both its own damage and hit force attributes, and those of its submunitions, except in the case of self-referential submunitions where only the damage of the parent projectile is used. A count can also be provided to increase the number of new projectiles created. The following lines can optionally be added as a "child" of the submunition:

  * `"facing" <angle#>`: an angle in degrees that is added to the parent projectile's angle to determine the submunition projectile's angle. Excluding this line means that the submunition always generates with the same angle as the parent projectile. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"offset" <x#> <y#>`: an *x,y* coordinate pair that cause the submunition projectile's generated location to be shifted from the parent projectile's death location by the given number of units in the x and y directions. Axes orientation is the standard Cartesian, where `+x` is "rightward" and `+y` is "upward." **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"spawn on" <type>...`: a list defining when the submunition can spawn. Accepted values are: `natural` for natural death of the source projectile, and `anti-missile` for destruction of the source projectile by an anti-missile system. Omitting this line means that the submunition is spawned only when the parent projectile dies naturally. **(v. 0.10.9)**

The following attributes are tags (just the word by itself, no value following it) which alter how a weapon fires or the behavior of its projectiles.

* `stream`: makes a weapon fire in "stream" mode (multiple copies of this weapon take turns firing) even if it is susceptible to anti-missile. Most weapons fire in stream mode by default. **(v. 0.9.0)**

* `cluster`: makes a weapon fire in "cluster" mode (all copies of the weapon fire at the same time, rather than alternating). Weapons with the anti-missile attribute fire in cluster mode by default. **(v. 0.9.0)**

* `safe`: if the weapon has the blast radius attribute, this tag causes explosions from this weapon's projectiles to not damage allied ships (unless they are explicitly targeted). **(v. 0.9.9)**

* `phasing`: enables the projectile to only hit the intended target (instead of perhaps colliding with a closer ship in the line of fire). If a ship has no target, then a phasing projectile will hit any hostile ship in the line of fire. Asteroids - even if targeted - are not hit by phasing weaponry. **(v. 0.9.9)**

* `"no damage scaling"`: prevents any damage scaling associated with blast damage from being applied: the nominal damage and hit force values are dealt at the center of the blast and at the very edges. **(v. 0.9.9)**

* `"gravitational"`: causes all ships impacted by this weapon to receive the same amount of hit force, as opposed to hit force decreasing in its effectiveness against heavier ships. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"parallel"`: causes this gun to fire in parallel when installed on a ship. This tag has no effect on turrets. See the [gun](CreatingShips) port definition for more information on parallel firing behavior. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"fused"`: causes this weapon's projectiles to explode once they reach the end of their lifetime. This means that the projectile will display a hit effect rather than a die effect, and any blast radius weapons will deal damage to ships that were nearby the projectile when it exploded. **(v. 0.10.7)**

* `"no ship collisions"`: this weapon's projectiles won't run collision detection against ships (unless this weapon is also `phasing` and has a target, in which case it will still detect collisions against the target). Weapons with a trigger radius will still explode when within range of an enemy. **(v. 0.10.7)**

* `"no asteroid collisions"`: this weapon's projectiles won't run collision detection against tiled asteroids. **(v. 0.10.7)**

* `"no minable collisions"`: this weapon's projectiles won't run collision detection against minable objects. **(v. 0.10.7)**

Ordinary weapon attributes (those that take a number as an argument) include:

* `lifetime`: how long the projectile lasts before it "dies."

* `"random lifetime"`: a random number of frames up to this amount will be added to each projectile's lifetime. **(v. 0.9.2)**

* `"fade out"`: the projectile will gradually fade out over this many frames before the end of its lifetime. **(v. 0.10.3)**

* `velocity`: initial velocity of the projectile, relative to whatever fired it (which may be a ship or a "parent" projectile of which this is a submunition).

* `"random velocity"`: a random amount up to this number will be added to the projectile's initial velocity. **(v. 0.9.0)**

* `acceleration`: projectile's acceleration, per frame. If this is nonzero, it should be coupled with a nonzero `drag` to limit the projectile's total speed.

* `drag`: percent loss of speed per frame. For example, a projectile with an acceleration of 1 and a drag of .1 will have a maximum speed (acceleration / drag) of 10.

* `turn`: If the projectile is homing, how much it is allowed to turn each frame to seek its target. Otherwise, it will *always* turn by this amount, which can be used to create spinning projectiles or other effects.

* `inaccuracy`: the maximum error, in degrees, in a projectile's firing angle. Inaccuracy limits a weapon's effectiveness at long range but can also make it look a bit more "natural" and unpredictable. Beginning in **v. 0.10.1**, how a weapon's inaccuracy is distributed can be controlled by the following child nodes:

  * `triangular`: the inaccuracy forms a triangular distribution, being 2/3rds as likely to appear in the middle 1/3rd of the angle, and 1/3rd as likely to appear in the outer 2/3rds of the angle. This is the default behavior if no distribution is defined, and was the only behavior prior to **v. 0.10.1**.

  * `uniform`: the inaccuracy forms a uniform distribution, being equally as likely to fire the projectile anywhere within the inaccuracy angle.

  * `[narrow | medium | wide]`: the inaccuracy forms a normal distribution with either a narrow, medium, or wide standard deviation (.13, .234, and .314 respectively).

  * `inverted`: inverts the distribution of only narrow, medium, or wide inaccuracies, so that projectiles are more likely to appear at the edges of the angle rather than the middle.

* `"turret turn"`: the number of degrees that this turret rotates per frame. (**v. 0.9.7**)

* `"arc"`: limit on the number of degrees that this turret can rotate. (For non-omnidirectional turret weapons.)

* The calculation for the range of a weapon involves multiplying its base lifetime by its base velocity. This value is what is used by the AI to determine when to fire the weapon given the distance to the target. The AI will also take any random velocity into account when aiming the weapon in order to properly lead the target. These base values may not always be entirely accurate as to how the AI should use a weapon though. Such situations may include weapons with acceleration and drag values that cause a projectile to travel much faster or slower than the base velocity, or weapons with very high inaccuracies that make using them at range impractical. It can also be the case that a weapon has a blast radius, which will by default cause ships to avoid firing the weapon if their target is close enough where the explosion with damage itself, although removing this behavior may be desired. The following attributes can be used in order to get more favorable results in how the AI uses the weapon:

  * `"range override"`: If provided, this value will be used to determine when the weapon should be fired instead of the normal range calculation. This will also be what is shown for the range of the weapon in the outfitter. **(v. 0.9.13)**
  
  * `"velocity override"`: If provided, this value will be used to determine how far to lead the target when firing. The higher this value, the less the AI will lead its target. **(v. 0.9.13)**

  * `"safe range override"`: If provided, this value will cause the ship to avoid firing this weapon if the target is closer than this value. By default, the safe range for all weapons is equal to the blast radius plus the trigger radius of the weapon (which for most weapons is zero). **(v. 0.10.0)**

* `"firing energy"`: the energy cost to fire this weapon.

* `"firing force"`: the thrust generated by firing this weapon.

* `"firing fuel"`: fuel consumed when this weapon fires.

* `"firing heat"`: heat produced when this weapon fires.

* `"firing hull"`: hull destroyed when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"firing shields"`: shield depleted when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"firing ion"`: ionization added when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"firing scramble"`: scrambling added when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.10.0)**

* `"firing slowing"`: slowing added when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"firing disruption"`: disruption added when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"firing discharge"`: discharge added when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.15)**

* `"firing corrosion"`: corrosion added when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.15)**

* `"firing leak"`: leak added when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.15)**

* `"firing burn"`: burn added when this weapon fires. **(v. 0.9.15)**

* `"relative firing energy"`: the energy cost to fire this weapon fires as a percentage of the ship's energy capacity. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"relative firing fuel"`: fuel consumed when this weapon fires as a percentage of the ship's fuel capacity. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"relative firing heat"`: heat produced when this weapon fires as a percentage of the ship's heat capacity. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"relative firing hull"`: hull destroyed when this weapon fires as a percentage of the ship's total hull. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"relative firing shields"`: shields depleted when this weapon fires as a percentage of the ship's total shields. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `reload`: how many frames this weapon takes to reload: 1 means it fires every turn (e.g. most beam weapons), and 60 means it fires once per second.

* `"burst count"`: how many projectiles this weapon can fire in a row at a higher reload rate (`"burst reload"`). The burst will reload fully after `reload * # of shots fired` frames from the first shot of the burst, making the reload time for a full burst `reload * "burst count"` frames. (This is technically the same as a non-burst weapon, as it effectively has a burst count of 1.) The number of frames between the end of a full burst and the start of the next burst is `"burst count" * (reload - "burst reload")`. **(v. 0.9.0)**

* `"burst reload"`: how many frames this weapon takes to reload between projectiles in a burst. This value must be less than the full `reload` value. For example, a weapon with a `reload` of `100`, `"burst count"` of `2` and `"burst reload"` of `5` will fire on the 1st and 6th frames, then on the 201st and 206th frames, and so on. The fraction of time that a burst weapon spends firing is `("burst reload" - 1) / reload`, where the weapon is considered firing on each frame where it has fired a projectile or is reloading the next projectile in the burst, with the final projectile in a burst being the end of the firing period. **(v. 0.9.0)**

* `homing`: How good this weapon is at seeking its target:

  * 0: no homing.

  * 1: projectile loses its homing ability if no longer facing toward the target.

  * 2: dumb homing (always try to turn to point toward the target).

  * 3: stop thrusting if you miss the target, in order to turn back towards it in a tighter loop.

  * 4: rather than moving directly towards the target, calculate an interception point based on the projectile's speed and the target's current speed.

* Tracking attributes (as of **v. 0.9.1**) control how well a projectile seeks targets, and accept values from 0 to 1:

  * `"infrared tracking"`: how well this projectile tracks targets based on their heat. That is, hot targets will be easier to track. 

  * `"optical tracking"`: how well this projectile tracks objects based on their size. That is, large targets will be easier to track.

  * `"radar tracking"`: how well this projectile tracks targets using radar (which ships can resist if they have `"radar jamming"`).

  * `tracking`: a form of tracking that is constant, regardless of the ship's size, heat, or radar jamming ability.

* `"missile strength"`: how hard a projectile is for an anti-missile to destroy. If this is 0, the projectile cannot be destroyed by anti-missile.

* The following weapon attributes turn a weapon into a special weapon that behaves differently from other weaponry. By including these attributes, the weapon will only automatically fire on specific targets and cannot be controlled manually. In addition, these special weapon attributes only work on turrets, do not spawn projectiles when they fire (although they will still create effects, and hit effects can be used to mimic a projectile's appearance), and have a range equal to their velocity (the lifetime should always be 1).

  * `anti-missile`: turns the weapon into an anti-missile turret and measures the weapon's ability to shoot down missiles. The anti-missile succeeds if a random integer less than this value is greater than a random integer less than the missile's strength.

  * `"tractor beam"`: turns the weapon into a flotsam tractor beam and measures the base velocity with which this weapon pulls in flotsam. Flotsam includes dumped cargo, destroyed minable payloads, and other dropped goods in space. The actual pull velocity is divided by the mass of the flotsam that is being pulled. **(v. 0.10.5)**

* `"split range"`: when the projectile is within this range of its target, it will split into its submunitions. (If no target was selected when the weapon was fired, this does nothing.)

* `"trigger radius"`: how close a projectile must be to a hostile target to trigger its explosion. This only makes sense to use with weapons with a `"blast radius"` at least as big as their `"trigger radius"`.

* `"blast radius"`: all ships (friendly and hostile) within this radius are damaged if this projectile explodes. Note: anything with a blast radius will show up on radar, like missiles do. Beginning in **v. 0.9.9**, any weapon with a blast radius is subject to damage scaling - objects closer to the center of the blast take more damage. Weapons with a trigger radius have their nominal damage boosted a small amount to compensate.

* `"hit force"`: how much thrust is applied to a ship when this projectile strikes it. If this is negative, the ship is pulled towards the projectile. Hit force associated with blast damage is also scaled. Ships with a greater mass are pushed around less by the same hit force value than a ship with a lower mass, unless the `"gravitational"` tag is present.

* `piercing`: a value between 0 and 1, controlling what fraction of the weapon's damage "pierces" through shields and does direct damage to the hull instead. When the target's shields are still up, shield damage will be `(1 - piercing) * "shield damage"` and hull damage will be `piercing * "hull damage"`. Beginning in **v. 0.9.13**, piercing is capable of having values greater than 1, but any value over 1 will be treated as 1. (When combined with piercing resistance, this can allow for a ship that can resist against all normal forms of piercing by having a resistance of 1, but a projectile with a piercing value greater than 1 could still hurt that ship.)

* `"penetration count"`: a value which determines the number of collisions that a weapon's projectiles can have before being destroyed. This allows projectiles to penetrate through both asteroids and ships. The default value is 1. If you set the penetration count to 0 then the projectile will be able to make about 65 thousand collisions before being destroyed, which is effectively infinite if you have a reasonably balanced weapon. **(v. 0.10.5)**

* `"damage dropoff"`: an attribute that can take one or two values denoting ranges at which this weapon's damage begins to change. The first value provided is the minimum dropoff range and the second value provided is the maximum dropoff range. Before the minimum range the weapon deals normal damage, while after the maximum range the weapon deals damage according to the dropoff modifier. Between these two ranges damage output changes linearly. If no second value is given then the maximum dropoff range becomes the range of the weapon. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* `"dropoff modifier"`: a value that dictates how a weapon's damage changes over range if the `"damage dropoff"` attribute is present. Values between 0 and 1 will result in reduced damage over range, while values greater than 1 are allowed and result in increased damage over range. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* There are several damage types, and a weapon may have more than one type. Generally, most weapons include shield and hull damage, as a ship's shields mitigate incoming damage, and without hull damage, the target cannot be eliminated. The normal damage types consist of the following:

  * `"shield damage"`: how much damage a projectile does to shields.

  * `"hull damage"`: how much damage a projectile does to the hull of ships or minables.

  * `"disabled damage"`: how much damage a projectile does to hull while the target is disabled. If omitted, the damage dealt while the target is disabled is the same as the normal hull damage. If included, this damage amount overrides the normal hull damage. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"minable damage"`: how much damage a projectile does to [minable objects](CreatingMinables). If present, this value is used in lieu of hull damage. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"prospecting"`: how much prospecting a projectile applies to a [minable object](CreatingMinables) upon impact. Prospecting increases the yield of a minable object by increasing the drop rate of its payloads. The equation for the increased drop rate of a payload is `drop rate + (1 - drop rate) / (1 + toughness / prospecting)`, where drop rate and toughness are attributes of the minable payload and prospecting is the total amount of prospecting applied to the minable before it was destroyed. **(v. 0.10.5)**

  * `"heat damage"`: how much heat is added to a target when struck by this projectile. If the target's shields are up, heat damage is cut in half.

  * `"fuel damage"`: how much fuel is removed from a target when struck by this projectile. If the target's shields are up, fuel damage is cut in half. **(v. 0.9.9)**

  * `"energy damage"`: how much energy is removed from a target when struck by this projectile. If the target's shields are up, energy damage is cut in half. **(v. 0.9.13)**

* All of the above damage types also come in "relative" forms that scale the exact amount of damage dealt depending on the stats of the ship impacted. **(v. 0.9.13)**

  * `"relative shield damage"`: shield damage that gets scaled according to the max shields of a target. A value of 0.5 means that one shot should take out 50% of the target's shields, regardless of how strong the target's shields are. Suggested that relative damage types be used on [system hazards](CreatingHazards) as a way to make hazards that affect all ships to a reasonable degree without crippling smaller/weaker ships (unless of course that is the intended effect).

  * `"relative hull damage"`: hull damage that gets scaled according to the max hull of a target ship or minable.

  * `"relative disabled damage"`: disabled hull damage that gets scaled according to the max hull of a target. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"relative minable damage"`: minable damage that gets scaled according to the max hull of a target minable. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"relative heat damage"`: heat damage that gets scaled according to the max heat capacity of a target (the point at which it becomes overheated). If the target's shields are up, heat damage is cut in half.

  * `"relative fuel damage"`: fuel damage that gets scaled according to the fuel capacity of a target. If the target's shields are up, fuel damage is cut in half.

  * `"relative energy damage"`: energy damage that gets scaled according to the energy capacity of a target. If the target's shields are up, energy damage is cut in half.

* There also exist various damage over time damage types. Each of these damage types dissipates at a rate of 1% per frame. For example, a ship that takes 10 ion damage will lose 10 energy that frame, 9.9 energy the next frame, 9.801 energy the next, and so on until ionization tapers off to 0. That means the total energy loss from that one ion impact will be 10 + 99% * 10 + 99% * 99% * 10 + ... = 10 / 1% = 1000 energy.

  * `"ion damage"`: how much ionization is added to a target when struck by this projectile, draining the target's energy over time. If the target's shields are up, incoming ion damage is cut in half. Beginning in **v. 0.9.15**, ionization also had the effect of scrambling damage. This was removed when scrambling damage was made its own damage type in **v. 0.10.0**.

  * `"scrambling damage"`: how much scrambling is added to a target when struck by this projectile, causing its weapons to have a chance to jam. If the target's shields are up, incoming scrambling damage is cut in half. The jamming chance is equivalent to `scrambling / (energy % * 220)`, where `energy %` is the percentage of energy that the ship has left relative to its energy capacity. The jamming chance caps out at 50%. Jammed weapons must go through another reload cycle before being able to attempt to fire again. **(v. 0.10.0)**

  * `"disruption damage"`: how much "shield disruption" is added to a target when struck by this projectile. Shield disruption causes a ship's shields to only block `1 / (1 + .01 * disruption)` of incoming weapon damage, while the rest pierces through the shields and damages the hull. For example, if a ship has accumulated 10 disruption, about 9% of damage will leak through to the hull. If the target's shields are up, incoming disruption damage is cut in half. **(v. 0.9.0)**

  * `"slowing damage"`: how much slowness is added to a target when struck by this projectile. Slowness multiplies the ship's turn rate and acceleration by `1 / (1 + .05 * slowness)`. If the target's shields are up, incoming slowing damage is cut in half. **(v. 0.9.0)**

  * `"discharge damage"`: how much discharge is added to a target when struck by this projectile, draining the target's shields over time. Incoming discharge damage always has maximum effect regardless of the state of the target's shields. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"corrosion damage"`: how much corrosion is added to a target when struck by this projectile, draining the target's hull over time. If the target's shields are up, all incoming corrosion damage is ignored. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"leak damage"`: how much leak is added to a target when struck by this projectile, draining the target's fuel over time. If the target's shields are up, all incoming leak damage is ignored. **(v. 0.9.15)**

  * `"burn damage"`: how much burn is added to a target when struck by this projectile, increasing the target's heat over time. If the target's shields are up, incoming burn damage is cut in half. **(v. 0.9.15)**

# Sales

In order for anyone to buy your new outfit, it must be added to one of the "outfitter" objects. For example, if you are writing a plugin, you could include this in one of your data files:

```
outfitter "Syndicate Advanced"
	"My Fancy New Outfit"
	"My Other Fine Outfit"
```

Any outfits you list will be appended to the outfits currently in the list you named. So, the above example would make two new outfits available on all planets that have the "Syndicate Advanced" outfits.

# Balancing

In Escape Velocity, the classic series of games that Endless Sky is patterned after, there were some outfits that were so powerful compared to their size that there was no reason not to install them if you could afford it: for example, outfits that took no space and improved your acceleration and turn rate, or very small outfits that boosted your shields considerably. As a result, those games needed to put a limit on how many of each outfit could be installed.

In Endless Sky, I'm attempting to have the balancing happen naturally, without putting fixed limits on how many copies of an outfit you can install. For example, that means that more powerful outfits tend to be larger or much more expensive (or both), and may have other side effects like generating a lot of heat or requiring more energy than other alternatives.

However, it is still quite possible to do things like buying a bulk freighter and installing 30 outfits expansions, which then lets you pack in an absurd number of shield generators. If outfits were provided that could increase your shield or hull strength, or your weapon or engine capacity, it would be very hard to keep the game balanced - a Bactrian freighter would have the capacity to be far more powerful than any warship, just because of its large cargo space.

So, when creating new outfits, it's important to keep in mind not just what you think would be cool, but whether your new outfits will be unbalanced. If you're creating a weapon that is so good that no ship will want to install anything else, that's a balance problem.
