Endless Sky needs contributions in a lot of different forms: artwork, story writing, beta testing, etc. I'm a professional C++ programmer, so the code is probably the area where I need the least help. But particularly if you have experience with modern OpenGL, I'd welcome your input!

If you are interested in contributing changes to the source code, first have a look at the [style guide](C++-Style-Guide). You will probably disagree on some of the style points. Your personal style is probably just as well-thought-out and elegant and professional-looking as mine. But, if the code becomes a jumble of everyone's personal styles, the end result will be ugly and inconsistent. (If you make a _really_ good case, I'm open to changing the style guide and going through all the code to make it match that change.)

If you're a new contributor, you can start by forking the [endless-sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) repository, making changes, and sending a pull request via GitHub. You can also post in the "Balance, Mechanics, and Interactions" section of the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/discussions) to describe the change you are working on.
